 # An Introduction to Swift and iOS Development

 [Swift is programming language introduced by Apple in June 2014](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). Since its inception it has gained popularity amongst developers and quickly becaming one of the [most starred projects on GitHub](https://github.com/showcases/programming-languages?s=stars).
 
 Swift can be used for developing for iOS and Mac but after [Apple open sourced the language late last year](https://swift.org/) many options have become more viable including Swift runnning on Linux servers and even an Android phone running Swift code!!
 
 Swift is built upon 3 core principles:
 
 * Safe
 * Modern
 * Interactive
 
 Swift is often described as a multi-paradigm programming language since it can conform to lots of different programming style like Object-Orientated, Functional Programming and even Protocol Orientated Programming.
 
 
 ### What is a playground?

 Well funny you ask that, because you're in one!! Playgrounds as the title explains are a place for you to try out your Swift code in an interactive environment. Starting the next page we will get you to type in an input and see the results.
 

 ### What is Xcode?
 
 Xcode is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which Apple make and forms the main piece of software for developing an iOS app in. Xcode is a complicated piece of software and contains all the tools you'll ever need for building an app including interface, layout, coding, debugging and testing. One slight downside is that Xcode is only available for the Mac.
